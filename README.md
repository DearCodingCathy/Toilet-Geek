### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.*

- Allow user to input borough
- Render data on page 
- Find picture to associate with each result

#### PostMVP  
*These are examples only. Replace with your own Post-MVP features.*

- Some advanced CSS
